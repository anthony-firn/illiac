### 1. **Create a Gatsby site.**

Use `git` to clone the site and navigate into it:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/anthony4tner/illiac project-name
cd project-name
```

### 2. **Install dependencies.**

If you use npm 7 or above use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag. If you use npm 6 you can use `npm install`.

```sh
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 3. **Open the code and start customizing!**

Start the site by running `npm run develop`.

Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

If you want to learn more about how you can use a Gatsby starter that is configured with a Gatsby theme, you can check out this [shorter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/using-a-gatsby-theme/) or [longer](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/using-a-theme/) tutorial. The tutorials don't exactly apply to this starter however the concepts are the same.

### Change your `static` folder

The `static` folder contains the icons, social media images and `robots.txt`. Don't forget to change these files, too! You can use [Real Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to generate the image files inside `static`.

### General

- **For most developers, I recommend starting with the [in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/).** It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.
